   abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. © 2012.},

@article{Taylor2021,
   abstract = {Stock assessment analysts are exploring an increasingly diverse and complex range of models while also facing higher expectations for consistency, documentation, and transparency in reports and management advice, all within a tight timeline. Meeting these goals requires increased efficiency at all steps in the assessment process from data processing, through model development and selection, to report writing and review. Here, we describe one widely used tool that has proven successful in increasing the efficiency of the assessment process: the r4ss package, which supports the use of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework. What began 15 years ago as a tool to provide simple model diagnostics, including plots showing data and model results, has grown into a large collection of R functions to support many aspects of the assessment process. We provide an overview of the r4ss features and illustrate its utility with examples from recent applications. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the ongoing development of r4ss that can be applied to similar efforts associated with the next generation of stock assessment packages.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis has increasingly been the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks around the world. Many decisions are required when developing integrated stock assessments. For example, the analyst needs to decide whether the model fits the data, if the optimization was successful, if estimates are consistent retrospectively, and if the model is suitable to predict future stock responses to fishing. This study provides practical guidelines for implementing selected diagnostic tools that can assist analysts in identifying problems with model specifications and alternatives that can be explored to minimize or eliminate such problems. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the implementation and interpretation of contemporary model diagnostic tools. We first describe each diagnostic approach and its utility. We then proceed by providing a “cookbook recipe” on how to implement each of the diagnostics, together with an interpretation of the results, using two worked examples of integrated stock assessments with Stock Synthesis. Further, we provide a conceptual flow chart that lays out a generic process of model development and selection using the presented model diagnostics. Based on this, we propose the following four properties as objective criteria for evaluating the plausibility of a model: (1) model convergence, (2) fit to the data, (3) model consistency, and (4) prediction skill. It would greatly benefit the stock assessment community if the next generation of stock assessment models could include the diagnostic tests presented in this study as a set of open source tools.}

abstract = { The conclusions drawn from fisheries stock assessment models can depend strongly on the relative weights assigned to different data sets. However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved. }

                    data are added to, or removed from, a stock assessment. These patterns are an
                    insidious problem, and can lead to severe errors when providing management
                    advice. Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in
                    selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in
                    integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on
                    retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model
                    misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters
                    and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn’s ρ (a
                    common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is
                    no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn’s ρ tends
                    to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn’s ρ differed among life histories, with different life
                    histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of
                    Mohn’s ρ is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias
                    in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values
                    of Mohn’s ρ which can be used to determine whether a stock
                    assessment shows a retrospective pattern.}",
